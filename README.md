## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   https://github.com/TheKingHippopotamus/Secure_Password_Manager.git
   cd password-manager
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the password manager:
   ```
   python -m password_manager
   ```
   or
   ```
   ./run.py
   ```

## Usage

### First-time Setup
On first run, you'll be guided through creating a master account:
1. Enter a master username (minimum 4 characters)
2. Create a strong master password (minimum 8 characters)
3. Confirm your master password

This master account will be used to encrypt and decrypt all your stored passwords.

### Main Menu
The interactive menu provides access to all functionality:
```
=== Password Manager ===
Logged in as: your_username
1. Generate a new password
2. Save a password
3. Find passwords
4. List all websites
5. Delete a password
6. Create backup
7. Show storage location
8. Logout
9. Exit
```

### Managing Passwords
- **Generate passwords** with customizable length and character sets
- **Save passwords** for different websites/services with username and optional notes
- **Find passwords** by searching for website or username
- **View all websites** stored in the system
- **Delete passwords** with confirmation and re-authentication

## Security Architecture

The application implements multiple layers of security:

### Key Derivation
1. Your master password is never stored in its original form
2. A unique salt is generated for each master account
3. Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) with 100,000 iterations is used
4. SHA-256 is used as the hashing algorithm

### Encryption Levels
1. **Machine-specific system key**: Derived from hardware identifiers and salt
   - Used to encrypt master username and password hash
   - Ties encrypted data to your specific device
   
2. **User-specific encryption key**: Derived from username, password, and salt
   - Used to encrypt/decrypt your password database
   - Requires both username and password to reconstruct

### Authentication Security
1. **Brute force protection**:
   - Limited login attempts (adaptive based on previous failures)
   - Device lockout after exceeded attempts
   - Increased security with each failed attempt
   
2. **Session security**:
   - Automatic timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - Sensitive operations require re-authentication
   - Activity tracking to prevent session hijacking

### Data Security
1. **Filesystem security**:
   - Sensitive files stored in restricted permission directory (`mode 0o700`)
   - Files are hidden from casual directory listings
   - Naming convention prevents accidental exposure
   
2. **Data integrity**:
   - Backups are encrypted with the same security as the main database
   - File operations use safe write patterns to prevent corruption

## Directory Structure

```
~/.password_manager/
├── password_manager.log    # Application log (non-sensitive information)
├── backups/                # Encrypted backup storage directory
│   └── .passwords_backup_[timestamp].enc  # Encrypted backups
└── secrets/               # Directory for sensitive files (restricted permissions)
    ├── .passwords.enc     # Encrypted password database
    ├── salt.bin           # Salt for key derivation
    ├── .master_user.enc   # Encrypted master username
    ├── .master_hash.enc   # Encrypted master password hash
    └── .login_attempts.dat # Login attempt tracking for lockout system
```

The package itself follows a modular architecture:
```

├── __main__.py          # Entry point
├── manager.py           # Main SecurePasswordManager class

├── encryption.py        # Encryption utilities

├── storage.py           # File storage operations
├── generator.py         # Password generation
├── utils.py             # Utility functions
├── logger.py            # Logging setup
└── constants.py         # Constants and configuration
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Password Generation
When generating passwords, you can specify:
- Password length (recommended 15+ characters)
- Whether to include special characters
- Whether to include uppercase letters
- Whether to include digits

Example of a highly secure password configuration:
- Length: 20+ characters
- Include all character types
- Resulting in an "Excellent" password strength rating

### Managing Sensitive Accounts
For highly sensitive accounts, consider:
1. Generating longer passwords (25+ characters)
2. Adding detailed notes about account recovery options
3. Creating regular backups after adding or updating important passwords

### Manual Backups
While automatic backups are created when using the backup feature, you can also manually copy the `.passwords.enc` file to a secure location for additional protection.

### Multi-Device Usage
This password manager is designed for single-device use with machine-specific encryption. For multi-device scenarios:
1. Install the password manager on each device
2. Create separate master accounts on each device
3. Use the built-in password generation on your primary device
4. Manually transfer passwords to secondary devices

## Security Best Practices

1. **Master Password Guidelines**:
   - Use a unique, strong master password (15+ characters)
   - Include a mix of character types
   - Avoid dictionary words and personal information
   - Consider using a passphrase of 4-5 random words

2. **Application Usage**:
   - Always log out when leaving your computer
   - Regularly create backups
   - Periodically review and update weak passwords
   - Do not run the application in untrusted environments

3. **System Security**:
   - Keep your operating system and Python updated
   - Use disk encryption on your computer
   - Protect your user account with a strong password
   - Consider using a firewall and antivirus protection

## Technical Details

### Cryptographic Implementation
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding (via Fernet)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2HMAC with SHA-256
- **Password Hashing**: SHA-256 with unique salt
- **Random Number Generation**: Cryptographically secure sources combined with time-based entropy

### Password Strength Evaluation
Passwords are evaluated based on:
- Length (30 points for 16+ characters)
- Character diversity (up to 60 points)
- Special characters (20 points)
- Uppercase letters (15 points)
- Digits (15 points)

Resulting in ratings:
- 80+ points: Excellent
- 60-79 points: Very Strong
- 40-59 points: Strong
- 25-39 points: Medium
- Below 25: Weak

### Lockout Mechanism
The adaptive lockout system:
1. Tracks login attempts per device
2. Reduces allowed attempts based on previous lockouts
3. Implements progressive security with repeated failures
4. Stores device identifiers and lockout information

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- cryptography library (for encryption)
- Operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Approximately 5MB of disk space
